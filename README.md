# Vessel Detection in Satellite Imagery using PyTorch

## Project Outline

The following is a broad outline for this project. 

### Phase 0 - Research

- Acquire and understand the data.
- Define the task.
- Get acquainted with the existing tools and technologies that are available.

Dataset used in the project comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery. For more information on the dataset, please refer to the [data](./docs/data.md) page.

Task: Binary classification of images into two classes: "ship" and "no-ship".


### Phase 1 - Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Phase 2 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP for the project is to create a classification model that classifies images into two classes: "ship" and "no-ship".

### Phase 3 - Model

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

input --> convolutional layers with filters to extract --> pooling layers for downsampling  --> connected layers for classification


### Phase 4 - Model Evaluation and Refinement

### Phase 5 - Further Work
