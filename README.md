# Vessel Detection in Satellite Imagery using PyTorch

## Project Outline

The following is a broad outline for this project. 

### Phase 0 - Research

- Acquire and understand the data.
- Define the task.
- Get acquainted with the existing tools and technologies that are available.

Dataset used in the project comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery. For more information on the dataset, please refer to the [data](./docs/data.md) page.

Task: develop a CNN that is able to perform semantic segmentation of vessels.

Model: possibly VGG, ResNet or a custom architecture.


### Phase 1 - Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Phase 2 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Simple CNN architecture with a few convolutional and connected layers.
- Able to train the CNN on the provided dataset.

### Phase 3 - Model

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

typical:
input --> convolutional layers with filters to extract --> pooling layers for down-sampling  --> connected layers for classification


### Phase 4 - Model Evaluation and Refinement

### Phase 5 - Further Work

- Classification into different types of vessels
